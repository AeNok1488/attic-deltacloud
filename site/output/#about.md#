<h2>How does Deltacloud work?</h2>
<p>Deltacloud contains a cloud abstraction API. The API works as a wrapper around a large number of clouds, abstracting their differences. For every <a href="/supported-providers.html" rel="tooltip" title="currently supported providers">provider</a> there is a driver "speaking" cloud provider's native API. It frees you from dealing with the particulars of each cloud's API.</p>

<p>Install Deltacloud and start the <strong>deltacloudd</strong> daemon server. You can use your favourite HTTP client to talk to the server using the Deltacloud REST API. Deltacloud even comes with a HTML interface so you can simply use your web browser to control your cloud infrastructure straight out of the box.</p>
