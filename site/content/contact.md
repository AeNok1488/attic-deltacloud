<h2>Deltacloud Community Calls</h2>

We are trying to establish regular community calls - right now they are held weekly every Thursday - at @ 1700 CET (Prague, Brno, GMT+1) - which means 0800 PST (US West Coast, GMT-8) or 1100 EST (US East Coast, GMT-5). These calls are open to anyone that is interested in Deltacloud - please contact us if you'd like to join the next call.

For now we're using an <a href="http://openetherpad.org/DeltacloudCall">etherpad</a> to keep track of the agenda. Feel free to add items there that you'd like to see addressed in future calls. Calls and agenda are announced on the  <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/deltacloud-dev/">dev@deltacloud.apache.org</a> mailing list.
